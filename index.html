                        The elections for the President of the United States take place every four years, with the
                        registered voters in each state and D.C. casting their ballots on <abbr
                            title="the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, i.e. the Tuesday that occurs within November 2 to November 8.">Election
                            Day</abbr>.<br />
                        But the election is a lot more complex than this. Let's see why!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="1">
                    <h1>The Popular Vote</h1>
                    <p class='p1'>
                        On the left, we can see how people in each state voted in the 2016 Presidential Election. Hover
                        over the states to see more information. The bar at the top shows the popular vote distribution
                        between the two big candidates from the Democratic Party (blue) and the Republican Party (red).
                        <br><br>

                        We see that Democrats swept the popular vote with a 48% share, with Republicans falling short at
                        46%.<br><br>
                        <em>But</em><br>
                        Donald Trump, the Republican candidate became the President in 2016. How so?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="2">
                    <h1>The Electoral College</h1>
                    <p class='p2'>
                        Behind that magic is the concept of the Electoral College. Simply relying on popular vote would
                        mean that big cities and populous states would have an outsized impact on the Presidential
                        election, with the smaller states' voice possibly getting sidelined. To avoid this, the Founding
                        Fathers decided to make the Presidential election as an indirect election.<br><br>

                        When voters vote on Election Day, they are voting to elect the Electoral College, not
                        the President and the Vice-President directly. Every state gets a certain number of electors -
                        one for each congressional district - with small states getting at least 3 electors, giving a
                        total of <b>538</b> votes. These electors then meet to elect the President and Vice President in
                        December. Therefore, to win, the candidate needs to win a simple majority, i.e. cross the
                        <b>270</b> barrier.<br><br>

                        Fun Fact - Except Nebraska and Maine, all states require a 'winner-takes-all' voting, wherein
                        all the electors in a state are required to vote for the candidate that won the popular vote.
                        Though it can be said that this is similar to simply using the popular vote, it has the effect
                        of giving smaller states a larger say in the Presidential vote and dampening down the impact of
                        popular vote from large cities.<br><br>

                        The chart on the left shows the electoral votes that each state had for the 2016 election. We
                        can see that the Republicans were able to successfully win many states , and though Democrats
                        won big states, they were unable to amass enough electoral votes to win the election.
