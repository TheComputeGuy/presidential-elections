                        The elections for the President of the United States take place every four years, with the
                        registered voters in each state and D.C. casting their ballots on <abbr
                            title="the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, i.e. the Tuesday that occurs within November 2 to November 8.">Election
                            Day</abbr>.<br />
                        But the election is a lot more complex than this. Let's see why!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="1">
                    <h1>The Popular Vote</h1>
                    <p class='p1'>
                        On the left, we can see how people in each state voted in the 2016 Presidential Election. Hover
                        over the states to see more information. The bar at the top shows the popular vote distribution
                        between the two big candidates from the Democratic Party (blue) and the Republican Party (red).
                        <br><br>

                        We see that Democrats swept the popular vote with a 48% share, with Republicans falling short at
                        46%.<br><br>
                        <em>But</em><br>
                        Donald Trump, the Republican candidate became the President in 2016. How so?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="2">
                    <h1>The Electoral College</h1>
                    <p class='p2'>
                        Behind that magic is the concept of the Electoral College. Simply relying on popular vote would
                        mean that big cities and populous states would have an outsized impact on the Presidential
                        election, with the smaller states' voice possibly getting sidelined. To avoid this, the Founding
                        Fathers decided to make the Presidential election as an indirect election.<br><br>

                        When voters vote on Election Day, they are voting to elect the Electoral College, not
                        the President and the Vice-President directly. Every state gets a certain number of electors -
                        one for each congressional district - with small states getting at least 3 electors, giving a
                        total of <b>538</b> votes. These electors then meet to elect the President and Vice President in
                        December. Therefore, to win, the candidate needs to win a simple majority, i.e. cross the
                        <b>270</b> barrier.<br><br>

                        <em>Fun Fact</em> - Except Nebraska and Maine, all states require a 'winner-takes-all' voting,
                        wherein
                        all the electors in a state are required to vote for the candidate that won the popular vote.
                        Though it can be said that this is similar to simply using the popular vote, it has the effect
                        of giving smaller states a larger say in the Presidential vote and dampening down the impact of
                        popular vote from large cities.<br><br>

                        The chart on the left shows the electoral votes that each state had for the 2016 election. We
                        can see that the Republicans were able to successfully win many states , and though Democrats
                        won big states, they were unable to amass enough electoral votes to win the election.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="3">
                    <h1>Red, Blue and Purple States</h1>
                    <p class='p3'>
                        While the electoral college ultimately decides the outcome of the presidential elections,
                        popular vote is important for a host of different reasons. The most important reason being that
                        it reflects the opinion of the voters, and is important not just morally, but also for deciding
                        the political strategy in upcoming elections.<br><br>
                        The chart on the left shows how each state and D.C. has voted in the past 12 presidential
                        elections. Ideally, there would be no clear pattern when it comes to elections, since popular
                        priorities and election promises will change every 4 years, and so will the issues and campaign
                        focus. Hover over your state to see how they voted in any given year.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="4">
                    <p class='p4'>
                        But, in reality, that is not true. There have been certain states which have consistently stayed
                        loyal to one party over the course of over 48 years! Nine of the 50 states have voted for the
                        Republican candidate in each election (by popular vote) since 1976, while only one state and
                        D.C. have voted for Democrats every year since 1976.<br><br>
                        <em>Fun Fact</em> - Even in his landslide 1984 victory, the Republican candidate, President
                        Ronald Reagan failed to win from Minnesota and D.C., which led to these two being the only
                        Democrat-voting states in this list. Coincidentally, Minnesota was the home state for the
                        democratic candidate Walter Mondale!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="5">
                    <p class='p5'>
                        If we zoom in further, we see that this partisan stability has expanded to a lot more states in
                        recent years. In the past 20 years, only 15 states <em>swung</em>, i.e., flipped their winning
                        candidates at least once, while 35 states and D.C. remained loyal to a single party. This led to
                        the terms 'red state' and 'blue state' being popularized, denoting party allegiances. This
                        number was even smaller between the 2016 and the 2020 elections, with only 5 states changing
                        "color".<br>
                        Although all states contain considerable numbers of both liberal and conservative voters, the
                        'winner-takes-all' methodology used by most states lead to this categorization. Similarly, even
                        though the state might seem to be politically inclined to one party, it is more complicated
                        locally, with the urban-rural divide associated with the largest differences.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="6">
                    <p class='p6'>
                        With most states opting for the 'winner-takes-all' strategy, winning the popular vote becomes
                        important, especially in states that have a large electoral college. And with certain states
                        historically voting for the same party, it might be counter-intuitive to expect that to change
                        without an objective reason. These two factors combined have led to candidates focusing their
                        time and resources campaigning only in certain states. These key states are called as
                        'battleground', 'purple' or '<b>swing</b>' states. <br><br>

                        Now, not every state with a large electoral college is a swing state. That distinction is
                        reserved only for the states where the fight is predicted to be close and could go either way.
                        These states are decided in the run up to the campaign by analyzing opinion polls, political
                        trends, recent voting patterns and candidate-specific factors too. Therefore, the swing state
                        map changes every election. <br><br>

                        Swing states are less impactful in landslide elections, and having a narrow margin does not
                        necessarily indicate a swing state - it is also about how close the race at the top is, which
                        decides whether the electoral college of a certain state will be impactful as a swing state.
                        This shows the complicated relationship between the popular vote and the electoral college.
                        <br><br>

                        The chart on the left shows the popular vote in the 2016 presidential elections, with states
                        with a small winning margin being shown in a fainter color. This election was noteworthy because
                        it featured one of the largest disparities between the popular vote and the electoral college.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-step="7">
                    <p class='p7'>
                        When discussing red and blue states, we mentioned that there are local disparities within a
                        state, especially between urban and rural counties. We dive deeper into this aspect now.<br>
                        The chart on the top shows the winning votes cast for the 2016 presidential election, in
                        counties with total votes greater than 100k. The further away from the center, larger is the
                        winning margin. The chart on the bottom shows the same but for counties with total votes less
                        than 100k. Larger the circle, more are the total votes cast.<br><br>

                        As we can see, Democrats command a victory in counties with large voting populations. Thus,
                        winning a smaller number of large counties can give the Democrats a huge popular vote share. On
                        the other hand, Republicans have a dominant position in a large number of small counties, with a
                        heavy rightward skew in the lower chart.<br>
                        Therefore, we see that the states in the midwest have traditionally been red states, while the
                        mid-Atlantic states and the west coast have become democratic strongholds. Studying at a more
                        granular level, we can see similar correlations within states as well - for example, Georgia
                        frequently turns out to be a battleground state because though most counties in Georgia vote
                        red, counties in urban areas in and around Atlanta are dominated by blue votes, leading to a
                        toss-up.
